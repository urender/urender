  This section describes the logical network interfaces of the device.
  Interfaces as their primary have a role that is upstream, downstream,
  guest, ....
type: object
properties:
  name:
    description:
      This is a free text field, stating the administrative name of the
      interface. It may contain spaces and special characters.
    type: string
    examples:
    - LAN
  role:
    description:
      The role defines if the interface is upstream or downstream facing.
    type: string
    enum:
    - upstream
    - downstream
  select-upstream:
    description:
      Any downstream interface can be masquaraded to an upstream interface. The default
      is that an upstream interface with a matching VLAN is selected. If the downstream
      interface has no vlan, the default upstream is used. This option provides the
      ability to override this selection.
    type: string
    enum:
    - match-vlan
    - default
    - none
    default: match-vlan
  isolate-hosts:
    description:
      This option makes sure that any traffic leaving this interface is isolated
      and all local IP ranges are blocked. It essentially enforces "guest network"
      firewall settings.
    type: boolean
  metric:
    description:
      The routing metric of this logical interface. Lower values have higher
      priority.
