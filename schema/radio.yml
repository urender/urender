description:
  Describe a physical radio on the AP. A radio is be parent to several VAPs.
  They all share the same physical properties.
type: object
properties:
  band:
    description:
      Specifies the wireless band to configure the radio for. Available radio device
      phys on the target system are matched by the wireless band given here.
      If multiple radio phys support the same band, the settings specified here will
      be applied to all of them.

    default: HE
  channel-width:
    description:

    - VHT
    - HE
  mimo:
    description:
      This option allows configuring the antenna pairs that shall be used.
      This is just a hint for the AP. If the requested value is not supported
      then the AP will use the highest common denominator.
